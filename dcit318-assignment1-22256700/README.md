# DCIT 318 Assignment 1

This repository contains three C# console applications:

## 1. GradeCalculator

The **GradeCalculator** application allows users to input a numerical grade (0-100) and outputs the corresponding letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F). It validates user input and ensures the grade is within the valid range.

## 2. TicketPriceCalculator

The **TicketPriceCalculator** application calculates the price of a ticket based on the user's age. Users aged 12 or below, or 65 and above, pay a discounted price; all others pay the standard price. The program validates the age input and displays the ticket cost.

## 3. TriangleTypeIdentifier

The **TriangleTypeIdentifier** application determines the type of triangle (Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene) based on the lengths of its three sides. It first checks if the sides can form a valid triangle and then identifies the triangle type.

Each project is self-contained and can be used to carry out the intended tasks outlined
